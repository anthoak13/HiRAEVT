RIBbit2

Contributors: Daniele Dell'Aquila, Juan Manfredi, ...

RIBbit2 will be a full unpacker and analysis program used by the HiRA collaboration. It will be based on the Juan Manfredi's RIBbit program as the initial unpacker (first stage). Further stages will be developed on it to allow detector mapping, calibrations and the extraction of physical information.
